# cups

Common Unix Printing System (CUPS), is the most widely used printing system on Linux systems. CUPS allows you to use,
manage and share many printers on the network, as it is designed as a client/server system.

This repository contains only build scripts for the CUPS daemon.

## Usage

To start cups directly over cli:

```bash
docker run \
  --detach \
  --env CUPS_ADMIN_USER=print \
  --env CUPS_ADMIN_PASSWD=print \
  --name cupsd \
  --network=host \
  --publish 631:631 \
  --volume /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus \
  docker.io/volkerraschek/cupsd
```

or if you want to use a `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  cupsd:
    container_name: cupsd
    environment:
    - CUPS_ADMIN_USER=print
    - CUPS_ADMIN_PASSWD=print
    image: docker.io/volkerraschek/cupsd
    ports:
    - 631:631
    restart: always
    volumes:
    - /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus
```

After starting the container, cups is available over `http://localhost:631` or over your FQDN.
